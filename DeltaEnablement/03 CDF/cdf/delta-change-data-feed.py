# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Delta Change Data Feed
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this notebook, we'll demonstrate an end-to-end of how you can easily propagate changes through a Lakehouse.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Bronze Table
# MAGIC Here we store all records as consumed. A row represents:
# MAGIC 1. A new patient providing data for the first time
# MAGIC 1. An existing patient confirming that their information is still correct
# MAGIC 1. An existing patient updating some of their information
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The type of action a row represents is not captured, and each user may have many records present. The field `mrn` serves as the unique identifier.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Silver Table
# MAGIC This is the validated view of our data. Each patient will appear only once in this table. An upsert statement will be used to identify rows that have changed.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Gold Table
# MAGIC For this example, we'll create a simple gold table that captures patients that have a new address.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Setup
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The following code defines some paths, a demo database, and clears out previous runs of the demo.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC It also defines a variable `Raw` that we'll use to land raw data in our source directory, allowing us to process new records as if they were arriving in production.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./Includes/cdc-setup

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Enable CDC using Spark conf setting; will be used on all Delta tables.

# COMMAND ----------

spark.conf.set('spark.databricks.delta.properties.defaults.enableChangeDataFeed',True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Confirm source directory is empty.

# COMMAND ----------

try:
    dbutils.fs.ls(Raw.userdir)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Ingest Data with Auto Loader
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Here we'll use Auto Loader to ingest data as it arrives.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The logic below is set up to either use trigger once to process all records loaded so far, or to continuously process records as they arrive.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We'll turn on continuous processing.

# COMMAND ----------

schema = "mrn BIGINT, dob DATE, sex STRING, gender STRING, first_name STRING, last_name STRING, street_address STRING, zip BIGINT, city STRING, state STRING, updated timestamp"

bronzePath = userhome + "/bronze"

(spark.readStream
    .format("cloudFiles")
    .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")
    .schema(schema)
    .load(Raw.userdir)
    .writeStream
    .format("delta")
    .outputMode("append")
#     .trigger(once=True)
    .trigger(processingTime='5 seconds')
    .option("checkpointLocation", userhome + "/_bronze_checkpoint")
    .start(bronzePath))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Expand the stream monitor above to see the progress of your stream. No files should have been ingested.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Use the cell below to land a batch of data and list files in the source; you should see these records processed as a batch.

# COMMAND ----------

Raw.arrival()
dbutils.fs.ls(Raw.userdir)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Create a Target Table
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Here we use `DEEP CLONE` to move read-only data from PROD to our DEV environment (where we have full write/delete access).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC `DEEP CLONE` does make a full copy of the source table; for large datasets, consider `SHALLOW CLONE`.

# COMMAND ----------

silverPath = userhome + "/silver"

spark.sql(f"""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS silver
    DEEP CLONE delta.`{URI}/pii/silver`
    LOCATION '{silverPath}'
""")

print(f"Deep cloned {URI}/pii/silver to\n{silverPath}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Enabling CDC as a Delta table property will ensure changes are always recorded, even if the Spark conf isn't set on the engineering cluster.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note that editing properties will version a table. Also note that no CDC is captured during the CLONE operation above.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC ALTER TABLE silver SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Use the Delta Lake API to Upsert Data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Load the silver Delta table for use in a merge statement.

# COMMAND ----------

from delta.tables import *

silver_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, silverPath)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Define a streaming reading against the bronze Delta table.

# COMMAND ----------

bronzeDF = (spark.readStream
    .format("delta")
    .load(bronzePath))

print(f"Reading stream from bronze path {bronzePath}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Here we define upsert logic, matching on our unique identifier `mrn`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We specify an additional conditional check to ensure that a field in the data has changed before inserting the new record.

# COMMAND ----------

    (silver_table.alias("t").merge(
        microBatchOutputDF.alias("s"),

#     .trigger(once=True)
    .trigger(processingTime='5 seconds')
    .start())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that we have an additional metadata directory nested in our table directory, `_change_data`

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.fs.ls(silverPath)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC We can see this directory also contains parquet files.

# COMMAND ----------

import time
time.sleep(5)

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.fs.ls(silverPath + "/_change_data")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Read the Change Data Feed
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To pick up the recorded CDC data, we add two options:
# MAGIC - `readChangeData`
# MAGIC - `startingVersion` (can use `startingTimestamp` instead)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Here we'll do a streaming display of just those patients in LA. Note that users with changes have two records present.

# COMMAND ----------

cdcDF = spark.readStream.format("delta").option("readChangeData", True).option("startingVersion", 0).table("silver")
display(cdcDF.filter("city = 'Los Angeles'"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC If we land another file in our source directory and wait a few seconds, we'll see that we now have captured CDC changes for multiple `_commit_version` (change the sort order of the `_commit_version` column in the display above to see this).

# COMMAND ----------

Raw.arrival()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Gold Table
# MAGIC Our gold table will capture all of those patients that have a new address, and record this information alongside 2 timestamps: the time at which this change was made in our source system (currently labeled `updated`) and the time this was processed into our silver table (captured by the `_commit_timestamp` generated CDC field).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Within silver table CDC records:
# MAGIC - check for max `_commit_version` for each record
# MAGIC - if new version and address change, insert to gold table
# MAGIC - record `updated_timestamp` and `processed_timestamp`
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Gold Table Schema
# MAGIC | field | type |
# MAGIC | --- | --- |
# MAGIC | mrn | long |
# MAGIC | new_street_address | string |
# MAGIC | new_zip | long |
# MAGIC | new_city | string |
# MAGIC | new_state | string |
# MAGIC | old_street_address | string |
# MAGIC | old_zip | long |
# MAGIC | old_city | string |
# MAGIC | old_state | string |
# MAGIC | updated_timestamp | timestamp |
# MAGIC | processed_timestamp | timestamp |

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Assuming that we have properly deduplicated our data to ensure that only a single record for our `mrn` can be processed to our silver table, `mrn` and `_commit_timestamp` (aliased to `processed_timestamp` here) serve as a unique composite key.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our join will allow us to match up the current and previous states of our data to track all changes.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This table could drive further downstream processes, such as triggering confirmation emails or automatic mailings for patients with updated addresses.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our CDC data arrives as a stream, so only newly changed data at the silver level will be processed. Therefore, we can write to our gold table in append mode and maintain the grain of our data.

# COMMAND ----------

(newDF.withWatermark("processed_timestamp", "3 minutes")
    .join(oldDF, ["mrn", "processed_timestamp"], "left")
    .filter("new_street_address <> old_street_address OR old_street_address IS NULL")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note the number of rows in our gold table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM gold

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC If we land a new raw file and wait a few seconds, we can see that all of our changes have propagated through our pipeline.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC (This assumes you're using `processingTime` instead of trigger once processing. Scroll up to the gold table streaming write to wait for a new peak in the processing rate to know your data has arrived.)

# COMMAND ----------

Raw.arrival()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC You should be able to see a jump in the number of records in your gold table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM gold

# MAGIC Make sure to run the following cell to stop all active streams.

# COMMAND ----------

for stream in spark.streams.active:
    stream.stop()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Propagating Deletes
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC While some use cases may require processing deletes alongside updates and inserts, the most important delete requests are those that allow companies to maintain compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. Most companies have stated SLAs around how long these requests will take to process, but for various reasons, these are often handled in pipelines separate from their core ETL.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Here, we should a single user being deleted from our `silver` table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DELETE FROM silver WHERE mrn = 14125426

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As expected, when we try to locate this user in our `silver` table, we'll get no result.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM silver WHERE mrn = 14125426

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC This change has been captured in our Change Data Feed.

# COMMAND ----------

cdcDF = spark.read.format("delta").option("readChangeData", True).option("startingVersion", 0).table("silver")
display(cdcDF.filter("mrn = 14125426"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Because we have a record of this delete action, we can define logic that propagates deletes to our `gold` table.

# COMMAND ----------

gold_table = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "gold")
gold_table.alias("g").merge(cdcDF.filter("_change_type='delete'").alias("c"), "g.mrn = c.mrn").whenMatchedDelete().execute()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC This drastically simplifies deleting user data, and allows the keys and logic used in your ETL to also be used for propagating delete requests.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM gold WHERE mrn = 14125426

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Committing Deletes
# MAGIC Unless a delete happens at a partition boundary, Delta Lake always writes new data files when a delete action occurs. Essentially, a delete in Delta marks a parquet file containing a row as invalid or tombstoned, instead pointing to a new data file not containing deleted rows. These invalid files are permanently removed during a `VACUUM` operation.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC By default, the Delta engine will prevent `VACUUM` operations with less than 7 days of retention. The cell below overrides this check.

# COMMAND ----------

spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that DBR 8.2 introduced logging of the Delta `VACUUM` operation. Run the cell below to ensure this logging is enabled.

# COMMAND ----------

spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.vacuum.logging.enabled", True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Adding the `DRY RUN` keyword to the end of our `VACUUM` statement allows us to preview files to be deleted before they are permanently removed. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note that at this moment we could still recover our deleted data by running:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC RESTORE silver
# MAGIC TO VERSION AS OF <version>
# MAGIC ```

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC VACUUM silver RETAIN 0 HOURS DRY RUN

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that executing `VACUUM` will also permanently remove the `_change_data` files associated with these versions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Executing the `VACUUM` command below permanently deletes these files.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC VACUUM silver RETAIN 0 HOURS

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC For safety, it's best to always re-enable our `retentionDurationCheck`. In production, you should avoid overriding this check whenever possible (if other operations are acting against files not yet committed to a Delta table and written before the retention threshold, `VACUUM` can result in data corruption).

# COMMAND ----------

spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled", True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that we can review our table history to see the details about our `VACUUM` operation.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC While we can see versions of our table from before our `VACUUM`, we will no longer be able to access these versions.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DESCRIBE HISTORY silver

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Run the cell below to drop the database and recursively delete all the data loaded to the workspace by this demo.

# COMMAND ----------

dbutils.fs.rm(userhome, True)
spark.sql(f"DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS {database} CASCADE")
